I have a condition called Narcolepsy with Cataplexy. Narcolepsy with Cataplexy is a chronic sleep disorder that affects an incredibly exclusive proportion of the population - around 1 in 2000. The condition is hard to diagnose although awareness is increasing. I was diagnosed a few years ago but I don't really find it easy to talk about the condition. It's important for friends and colleagues to understand the condition a little bit so here I present "Narcolepsy: A Geek's Guide". And I am sorry to call you all "geeks".


*Disclaimer:* I have tried to research as much into the condition as I can although I have been liberal with personal anecdotes. If you have any corrections, please drop a comment below!


What is Narcolepsy?
-------

Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder that is caused by the brain's inability to regulate the sleep-wake cycle. 


Bummer. So what happens when you have a poorly regulated sleep-wake cycle?
----------

Well it's not all completely drastic - it's a little bit like when government systems break down during a minor coup - the important still happens, just things are a little chaotic and disorganised. In terms of sleep-wake cycles it just means that we don't tend to have normal sleep patterns and some aspects of sleep tend to make their way into our waking time.

Normal sleep patterns?
----------

A hypnogram is a visualisation of the stages of sleep over period of time (taken from an EEG during sleep). Take a look at a typical hypnogram for somebody without Narcolepsy:

![Normal hypnogram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Sleep_Hypnogram.svg )

_Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#Physiology)_

There are several
[stages of sleep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#Stages that are
broadly be categorised into "REM" (rapid eye movement) and "NREM"
(non-rapid eye movement). Upon sleep onset, you fall into NREM
mode. This is the deep, restorative sleep that makes you feel rested
and wonderful upon waking. Although it is not unheard of, you don't
tend to dream in this stage. REM is a lighter sleep phase, in which you
tend to dream. If you woke up this morning after a really strange
dream, that was probably something that occurred during REM
sleep. Humans typically spend about 25% of their night's sleep in REM
mode. As the above hypnogram shows you tend to oscillate between these
phases in a fairly consistent way.

As a contrast, this is your brain on Narcolepsy:

The key differences to note:

+ Narcolepsy sufferers stay for longer in REM than NREM, so get less
  good quality restorative sleep for the same amount of time asleep.
+ Narcolepsy sufferers tend to wobble between REM and NREM in an
  erratic manner

Crazy stuff you say?
--------------

The official terms for the phenomena narcoleptics tend to experience
on falling asleep are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia">Hypnogogic
Hallucinations</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis">Sleep
Paralysis</a>. They occur because we are still conscious and aware,
but our body is dropping into REM sleep prematurely.


Hypnogogic hallucinations are the vivid and sometimes distressing
dreams - they can be visual, auditory, sensation - occurring on that
boundary between being awake and asleep. I get these pretty much every
time I fall asleep - even if it is for a few minutes. When it first
started happening to me, it was kind of terrifying because it feels so
very real: I went through a phase of waking up 'levitating' or being
dragged across the floor, or of people walking into my room and
creepily staring at me, or mice running round my bed.


After a few years you get used to it - the scarier stuff is normally
triggered by stress or jet-lag so avoiding stress is helpful. In fact,
many people try desperately to experience this phenomena (they call it
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream">lucid dreaming</a>)
so in a way I am kind of lucky I guess!


Sleep paralysis is an entirely natural shutdown of the body's movement
functions when you drop into REM sleep - during NREM muscles are not
paralysed. This stops you doing things like acting out dreams and
punching your sleeping partner etc. So it's a pretty useful
function. The only problem is that if you are moving straight into REM
sleep rather than the deeper NREM sleep, your brain is still aware so
you actually witness the sleep paralysis as it kicks in. That coupled
with the hallucinations can be a little distressing if you don't know
what is happening [1]. In my experience you can either sit patiently
and wait for it to be over, or try to wiggle your toes to send a few
signals down the body and wake it up again.


How good a night's sleep do you get after all that?
---------------

Sleeping through the night is something I don't really remember doing. As I am waking every three hours, I try to get a lot more sleep than normal folks. That means 8 minimum, ideally 9 or 10. If I have had a bad night's sleep, I let myself sleep in if I can. Unless there is a pressing reason to be somewhere early, I weigh up the benefit of having a normal, functioning Jen or one that shows for stand-up at 9:15. 


So what about during the day?
-----------

Even with the extra hours sleep, I still get sleepy during the
day. This is officially called "excessive daytime sleepiness". You
know when it's late in the afternoon, you are sat there quietly after
a heavy lunch and your eyelids begin to sink and you have trouble
concentrating? That's essentially what I am talking about - except it
happens all the time, not just after a boozy lunch.


A characteristic of these little, uncontrollable naps is that after
about 10 minutes of hovering on the boundary, I might lose
consciousness for less than a minute, suddenly wake and be completely
refreshed. It's the ultimate power-nap.


Unfortunately this is probably the most debilitating of my
symptoms. Partly because it's misunderstood by people around me as
boredom or disrespect or I am laughed at or told to "go for a nap"
like I am a child. This tends to make me pretty defensive and grumpy
about the whole thing. The best way for people around me to deal with
this situation is to leave me be as it is only temporary (and I am
embarrassed enough to begin with) but with the caveat that they
intervene if I start snoring or I fall asleep with my mouth open! And
please take my advanced apology for being grumpy with you!

Can you take anything for this?
---------

Happily for the last few months I have been prescribed a drug called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil">Modafinil</a> - it
has the effect of basically taking the edge off the excessive daytime
sleepiness. Unless I really have had no sleep, I can manage to get
through the day without dropping off. I have attended a couple of
conferences since I started taking the medication and I managed to
stay awake through all of them (even with jet-lag). There is still
potential for the effect to decrease but I am enjoying this new found
wakefulness where I can.


Is that it?
------------

Nope. The last, but by very no means the least of the symptoms is the
one that forms part of the full name "Narcolepsy with Cataplexy".

Wikipedia: "[Cataplexy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataplexy) is a
sudden and transient episode of loss of muscle tone, often triggered
by emotions such as laughing, crying, terror, etc."

Yes, it is as weird as it sounds. If I find something suddenly,
hilariously funny my mouth goes slack. This might spread to my neck,
knees, arms. If I don't find something or someone to slump on, I can
end up falling to the floor. Other emotions that trigger it are
intense surprise, happiness and sudden anger. A few seconds and it has
generally gone. I don't lose consciousness during the episode, but
obviously softening muscles affects the mouth and tongue so speech
becomes a problem.

Again this is caused by REM poking it's nose into my everyday
activity. I believe some theories attribute the phenomenon to sleep
paralysis kicking in where it shouldn't. Again, it becomes something
you cope with. I slump on the desk and put my head in my hands if I
find something funny (which is a little odd but if you know me I am
already a little odd). It's a little awkward if it is something that
is completely and utterly inappropriate like unintentional innuendo,
as I cannot hide easily that I found something funny,


That's a lot of symptoms
----

Yeah. Sympathy please ;). Just kidding. It's basically three different
components:

+ Excessive Daytime Sleepiness
+ Cataplexy
+ Sleep paralysis/hypnagogic hallucinations

All based on the irregularity of my sleep-wake cycle.

So what causes this irregularity of the sleep-wake cycle?
----------

(As Jennifer Aniston says, here comes the science bit)

As far as I am aware there are several forms of Narcolepsy, but they are pretty sure that the one I have (Narcolepsy with Cataplexy) is caused by a lack of a neurotransmitter called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orexin">orexin/hypocretin.</a>

Neurotransmitters are little 'chemical messengers' released by neurons
over a synapse and taken up by neuron receptors and other cells -
depending on the type of neurotransmitter and the receptor these may
be excitatory (do more stuff) or inhibitory (do less stuff). The act
of different neurons firing different neurotransmitters causes a
series of chain reactions that eventually manage to get stuff done -
feeling pain, hunger, feeling pleasure, pain, euphoria, write things
to memory.

Orexin is the neurotransmitter responsible for regulating the
sleeping, waking and appetite. Note that it doesn't directly cause the
specific functions of sleep to happen, but it is there to regulate
these functions and make sure they happen at an appropriate time. So
it follows that a lack of orexin causes a lack of sleep-wake
regulation.

Where did the orexin go?
---------

The lack of orexin is down to an absence of the cells in the
hypothalamus that produce it. <a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803042/">Recent</a>
<a
href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-05/sumc-nia042809.php">research</a>
has identified that this is likely to be as a result of an auto-immune
response. I am only fully starting to understand the details but as my
neurologist explained, there is some chance that I had an upper
respiratory tract infection in my teens and the immune cells decided
to hang around and kill some of the orexin-producing cells while they
were at it.



Teenagers with colds are hardly rare and I was not a particularly
sickly teenager so why doesn't half the planet suffer from Narcolepsy?
Well it turns out that it is all down to a specific version of a
specific part of my copy of chromosome 6: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen">HLA</a>. Well
actually, <a
href="http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/interpretive-guide/?alpha=N&amp;unit_code=82026">more
specifically</a> <a
href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HLA-DQB1">HLA-DQB1</a> and the
specific version of that genetic software I am likely to be running:
HLA-DQB1*06:02. It is the combination of the specific marker, some
sort of cough or cold and a tiny little bit of bad luck.



Is there a cure?
------------

Nope. Not yet, and probably not in my lifetime. Knowing this brings a
lot of acceptance of the condition. When I was first diagnosed, I was
quite upset as I decided that it was going to stop me doing things and
I set stupid limitations on myself. I was also terrified of telling
people I worked with due to the misunderstanding of the condition. As
I have got used to the condition and a tiny bit older too, I have
accepted that Narcolepsy is a part of who I am and people have to
accept this. and while it makes some things tough, most of the time
the only thing holding me back is me. OK and the drugs help too :).


Comments/questions/gripes?
------

One thing about Narcolepsy being a rare (though if evidence is to be
believed [growing](http://www.thebloomsbury.com/event/run/1831))
condition is that I have never met anyone with the condition not least
with the same balance of symptoms as I have.


If you are reading this with the same condition as me and you think
something is not quite accurate, please feel free to add a comment. I
have tried to research as much into the condition as I can although I
have been liberal with personal anecdotes. Let me know if I have any
of the neurological explanations completely wrong or misleading too!
