I was hunting for a decent letter template on google docs and could not
for the life of me find one. I like to have the recipient address on the
left and the sender on the right rather than all on one line. There is a
lot of weird stuff in the public templates site! Anyway, here is the
template:

<iframe width="620" height="170" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://docs.google.com/embeddedtemplate?id=0Adhg3tLfif75ZGc0aHJyeDdfMTE1ZnFtd3E3Y3E">
Test </iframe>

... Enjoy
