I spent the first half of last week hanging out in Aarhus for
GOTO. This was my first time at GOTO - I have been to QCon a few times
so I guess I knew what to expect. Both GOTO and QCon are very Software
Development centric conferences, covering a broad range of topics. I
found that I tended to stick to one or two tracks a day so my
conference experience tended to focus on continuous delivery
and NoSQL.

One notable thing about GOTO is the fact that the speakers are
invited. I think in many cases that lead to some really interesting
and well executed talks. However there were a few that failed in the
timing/audience consideration/delivery stakes which was a shame but I
still enjoyed a great many of the talks.

### The Keynotes

There were
[five keynote speakers](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/keynotes/) - I
managed to get to four of them. Ideally keynotes for me should be
entertaining and informing but very much swayed towards the
entertaining. It's great when they are on an unfamiliar but
interesting topic.

Damian Conway's
[talk](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/Contratemporal%20Virtual%20Nanomachine%20Programming%20In%20Topologically%20Connected%20Quantum-Relativistic%20Parallel%20Spacetimes...Made%20Easy%21)
\- not sure I can fully do the title justice in my 640px layout -
greatly demonstrated all that I think a keynote at a tech conference
should be. I don't want to give too much away as it is well worth
watching a video of the talk so I will just leave you with part of the
abstract:
> Watch in horror as Damian writes a Perl program to extract square
> roots using nothing but quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the
> very fabric of the space-time continuum.

My only regret was that this was at the end of the first, pretty
exhausting day. I would like to have been more alert to follow the
craziness that Damian seemed to be conjuring with only perl as his
weapon.

### NoSQL

There was a good representation from many of the NoSQL vendors both in
the booths and in the talks. This was not more fully demonstrated than
at
[The Aarhus 6](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/The%20Aarhus%206)
panel discussion with Neo4j, CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra and Riak
represented. It was a pretty entertaining session with some
interesting discussion but I am not sure I came away with it massively
more clear on when I would use a KV store and when I would use a graph
database. 

I found that Martin Fowler's
[Introduction to NoSQL](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2012/presentation/Introduction%20to%20NoSQL)
would have been a great prelude to most of the NoSQL talks. I
think it was a good introductory talk and I appreciated the
distinction between aggregate
